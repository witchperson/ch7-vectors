# Exercise 5: vector practice

# Create a vector `words` of 6 (or more) words.
# You can Google for a "random word generator" if you wish!
words <- c("the","quick","brown","fox","jumped","over","lazy","dog")

# Create a vector `words.of.the.day` that is your `words` vector with the string
# "is the word of the day!" pasted on to the end.
# BONUS: Surround the word in quotes (single or double) (e.g., `"data" is the 
# word of the day!`)
words.of.the.day <- paste0("'", words,"' is the word of the day!")
words.of.the.day

# Create a vector `a.f.words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
# "a" through "f"
# Hint: use a comparison operator to see if the word comes before "f" alphabetically!
# Tip: make sure all the words are lower-case, and only consider the first letter
# of the word!
a.f.words <- words[substring(words,1,1) <= "f"]
a.f.words

# Create a vector `g.m.words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
# "g" through "m"
g.m.words <- words[words >= "g" & substring(words,1,1) <= "m"]
g.m.words
#g.words <- words[words >= "g"]  # alternative approach
#g.m.words <- g.words[g.words <= "m"]

# Define a function `WordBin` that takes in three arguments: a vector of words, 
# and two letters. The function should return a vector of words that go between 
# those letters alphabetically.
WordBin <- function(words, start, end){
  return(words[words >= start & substring(words,1,1) <= end])
}

# Use your `WordBin` function to determine which of your words start with "e" 
# through "q"
WordBin(words, "e", "q")

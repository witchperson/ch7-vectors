# Exercise 5: vector practice

# Create a vector `words` of 6 (or more) words.
# You can Google for a "random word generator" if you wish!


# Create a vector `words.of.the.day` that is your `words` vector with the string
# "is the word of the day!" pasted on to the end.
# BONUS: Surround the word in quotes (single or double) (e.g., `"data" is the 
# word of the day!`)


# Create a vector `a.f.words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
# "a" through "f"
# Hint: use a comparison operator to see if the word comes before "f" alphabetically!
# Tip: make sure all the words are lower-case, and only consider the first letter
# of the word!


# Create a vector `g.m.words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
# "g" through "m"


# Define a function `WordBin` that takes in three arguments: a vector of words, 
# and two letters. The function should return a vector of words that go between 
# those letters alphabetically.


# Use your `WordBin` function to determine which of your words start with "e" 
# through "q"
